Tomáš Vinař, PhD\r\n\r\n### Idea\r\nDNA sequencing is currently a hot topic with a lot research and potential. One of important thing we would like to do is to compare two different DNA sequences and determine where they differ. This would be a straight forward process if we would have the correct sequences. Unfortunately we do not have the access to the original sequence, because we can not directly measure the whole DNA.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of short substrings from the original DNA sequence. This short substrings are called reads. A standard procedure is to take reads and construct a De Bruijn graph. Based on paths in this graph we can reconstruct the most likely original DNA sequence. Comparing two DNA sequences means to compare two most likely sequence reconstructions. In case we have a lot of (good coverage) high precision reads, this is the best think we can do. However a lot of genomes do are sequenced with small coverage in sake of speed and price. \r\n\r\nFor example let's look on a cancer diagnostic. We would sequence a suspicious cell's DNA and we would like to compare it with a presumably healthy cell. Right now we can not afford to sequence those cells with high coverage so our DNA reconstruction, however we do not care about the whole sequences. We just want to see the most probable difference between them. This difference than could be a symptom of a cancer.\r\n\r\n### Materials \r\nWe will build on top of Mr. Boza's work on probabilistic [GAML](https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-015-0052-6). We will try to extend this approach to compare sequences before the final reconstruction, therefore we will directly compare De Bruijn graphs.\r\n\r\n### Sections\r\n#### Overview\r\nHere I will go through a basic terminology and proper problem definition\r\n\r\n#### Current methods\r\nHere I will test current state of the art methods for finding the differences and I will try to set their limits. These results will be benchmarks for our methods.\r\n\r\n#### Probabilistic model\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\nHere we will present details of our implementation and test it on synthetic data as well as on actually measured data.\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\nHere we will find cancer.\r\n\r\n#### Future plans and extensions\r\nHere we will describe possible extensions of this work and thinks that could be improved.\r\n",
