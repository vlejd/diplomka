\chapter{Genome differences}
\section{Definitions 2-3p}
Here we define theory necessary to for this thesis.
\section{Comparative genomic 1-2p}
Here we show some of current methods used in comparative genomic, which studies the differences between genomes.
\section{Probabilistic approach 2-4}

\section{Genome alignments 3-4}
Brief mentions of current genome alignments approaches.
\section{Evaluation 2-3}
Here we discuss what metrics we want to improve and what is the measure of success for our solution.

\chapter{Read statistics}
Here we evaluate some statistics about commonly used data.
Here we evaluate current used methods and set benchmarks for our solution.
\section{Reads 1-2}
Here we evaluate data for reads and we set our expectations about these data.
\section{Paired reads 1-2}
Here we evaluate data for paired reads and we set our expectations about these data.
\section{Benchmarks 3-4}
Here we benchmark some used tools for our problem.
